# Virology Blog
[Virology.ws](Virology.ws) is the creation of [Vincent Racaniello Ph.D](https://www.virology.ws/about/) Professor of Microbiology & Immunology in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University.</br>

This small set of scripts is to scrape the blog daily, and update the contents to a .csv file with the Blog: date posted, post title, and link. Dr. Racaniello reached out via social media and asked for some assistance with indexing the blog. As a long time listener of all the TWiX podcasts, I was happy to provide this project.</br>
