# Virology Blog
[Virology.ws](https://www.virology.ws/) is the creation of [Vincent Racaniello Ph.D](https://www.virology.ws/about/) Professor of Microbiology & Immunology in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University.</br>

Dr. Racaniello reached out via social media and asked for some assistance with indexing the blog. As a long time listener of all the TWiX podcasts, I was happy to provide this project.  This small set of scripts crawls the blog daily, and updates the contents to a .csv file with the Blog: date , title, and link. </br> 

Please follow all of Dr. Racaniello's podcast:
